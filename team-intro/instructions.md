## Suggested Steps

1. One team member creates a repository _INT100_group_number-team_number-team_name__ e.g. _**INT100-G0-00-SuperFly**_
   1. Create a file `our-team.md` in the repo
1. Invite your team members to become collaborators on the repository
1. Each member creates a branch of the repository to add his/her content to the `our-team.md` file.
2. Issue: create an issue to discuss your team name.  Add information about how you decide on your team name to your `our-team.md` file.
3. Issue: create issues to discuss what details you will include when introducing your teammate, such as pictures, links to their social media pages, etc.  You must have pictures and links.
- REQUIRED `markdown`: picture (upload to GitHub and use relative link), link to more info outside of GitHub, list, emoji
5. Interview your teammate(s). _each member_ adds an introduction for a _*different*_ teammate to `our-team.md` using markdown.  Be sure to indicate who is writing the introduction.
6. Each member makes a `pull request`, the team reviews and approve the `merge` of the introduction to the `main` branch.
7. Invite aj.Siam and P'Peaw to your repo. (see user id at [`student-info.md`](/student-info.md))
